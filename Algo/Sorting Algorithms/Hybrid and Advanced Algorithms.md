1. **Tim Sort**
    - **Description:** A hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on real-world data by exploiting runs (already sorted subarrays).
      
    - **Time Complexity:** O(nlog⁡n)
    - **Space Complexity:** O(n)
      
2. **Comb Sort**
    - **Description:** Similar to bubble sort but compares elements at a larger gap, gradually reducing the gap.
      
    - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
      
3. **Bogo Sort** (Highly inefficient, for educational purposes only)
    - **Description:** Randomly shuffles the array until it is sorted.
      
    - **Time Complexity:** O((n!)⋅n)
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
