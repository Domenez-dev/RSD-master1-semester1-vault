#### 1. **Introduction to RDBMS and System R**

A **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** is a type of DBMS that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. It was first introduced by IBM's **System R** project in the 1970s, which aimed to make data management more efficient and accessible by organizing it into tables (relations).

- **System R**: The first prototype RDBMS, designed to demonstrate the viability of relational models.
  - **Goal**: To provide a platform that could handle large volumes of structured data using a language called SQL.
  - **Contribution**: Introduced SQL as the standard query language and influenced modern RDBMS development.

#### 2. **Core Concepts in RDBMS**

   - **Relation**: In RDBMS, a relation is a table with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
   - **Tuple**: Each row in a table, representing a single record.
   - **Attribute**: Each column in a table, representing a property or characteristic of the entity.
   - **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each row (e.g., a student ID in a student table).
   - **Foreign Key**: A reference to a primary key in another table, creating a relationship between two tables.

#### [3. Tables](Tables.md)

[Tables](Tables.md) are the fundamental building blocks of relational databases. They store data in a structured format using rows and columns, enabling efficient querying and manipulation. This course covers the structure, creation, manipulation, and best practices for working with tables in a database management system (DBMS).

---

#### 3. **Data Integrity and Constraints**

RDBMS enforces rules to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data.

- **Entity Integrity**: Ensures each row has a unique identifier (primary key cannot be null).
- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys must refer to valid primary keys in related tables.
- **Constraints**:
  - **NOT NULL**: Attribute values cannot be null.
  - **UNIQUE**: Values in the column must be unique.
  - **CHECK**: Ensures attribute values meet a specified condition.
  - **DEFAULT**: Sets a default value if none is provided.

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

---

#### 4. **SQL (Structured Query Language)**

SQL is the language for managing and querying data in RDBMS. It has several categories:

- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Defines database schema (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Handles data within tables (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Controls access (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).
- **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**: Manages transactions (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

---

#### 5. **Schema and Catalog**

- **Schema**: The structure or design of the database, including tables, columns, data types, etc.
- [**Catalog**](Catalogs.md): Metadata repository in an RDBMS that stores information about database objects (tables, indexes, views).

**Example**: In SQL Server, the catalog stores details on table structures, data types, indexes, and views.

---

#### 6. **Relational Algebra and SQL Operations**

[Relational Algebra](SQL%20Operations.md) is a formal system of operations on relations, forming the theoretical foundation of SQL.

- **Select (σ)**: Filters rows based on a condition.
- **Project (π)**: Selects specific columns from a table.
- **Join (⨝)**: Combines rows from two tables based on a condition.
- **Union (∪)**: Combines rows from two relations with the same schema.
- **Intersection (∩)**: Returns rows common to both relations.
- **Difference (-)**: Returns rows in one relation but not in another.

**Example (SQL)**:

```sql
-- Select students older than 18
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 18;

-- Join tables
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id
JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.course_id;
```

---

#### 7. **Normalization**

Normalization is the process of structuring tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Forms of normalization include:

- **1NF**: Atomic values in columns.
- **2NF**: No partial dependency on any part of the primary key.
- **3NF**: No transitive dependencies on non-key attributes.

**Example**: A table holding student and course information could be split into separate tables with `student_id` and `course_id` keys.

---

#### 8. **Indexes and Performance Optimization**

[Indexes](Indexes.md) speed up data retrieval by providing a way for the RDBMS to find data without scanning the entire table.

- **Types of Indexes**:
  - **Primary Index**: Built automatically on the primary key.
  - **Secondary Index**: Built on non-key columns for faster access.
  - **Composite Index**: Built on multiple columns to speed up complex queries.

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_student_age ON students (age);
```

---

#### 9. **Transactions and ACID Properties**

[Transactions](Transactions.md) ensure data integrity using **ACID** properties:

- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction must succeed or fail together.
- **Consistency**: Ensures data follows all constraints.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not affect each other.
- **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, it persists even in a failure.

**Example**:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

---

#### 10. **Joins and Relationships**

Joins are used to retrieve related data from multiple tables.

- **Types of Joins**:
  - **Inner Join**: Only matching records.
  - **Left Join**: All records from the left table and matched records from the right.
  - **Right Join**: All records from the right table and matched records from the left.
  - **Full Join**: All records from both tables, with matches where available.

---

#### 11. **Views**

A [**View**](views.md) is a virtual table created by a query. It helps in data security, simplification, and managing complex queries.

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE VIEW adult_students AS
SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age >= 18;
```

---

#### 12. **Stored Procedures and Triggers**

- **Stored Procedures**: Reusable SQL code blocks that can accept parameters.
- **Triggers**: Automated actions triggered by changes in the database.

**Example of Stored Procedure**:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE update_salary (IN emp_id INT, IN new_salary DECIMAL)
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET salary = new_salary WHERE id = emp_id;
END;
```

---

#### 13. **Security in RDBMS**

Security measures include authentication, role-based access control, and encryption.

**Example**:

```sql
CREATE USER 'analyst'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
GRANT SELECT ON students TO 'analyst'@'localhost';
```

---

#### 14. **Backup and Recovery**

Backups are essential for data safety, and RDBMS provides several methods for recovery.

- **Logical Backup**: Exports schema and data.
- **Physical Backup**: Copies entire database files.
